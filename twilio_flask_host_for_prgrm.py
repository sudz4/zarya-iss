"""   
the Flask class is the main class from the Flask web framework.
Flask represents a web application
provides all the necessary functionality to handle HTTP requests, manage routes, serve static files, and more

"""

"""  
When you run a Python script directly (e.g., python app.py), the __name__ variable is set to '__main__'. 
When you import a module (e.g., import app), the __name__ variable is set to the module's name (in this case, 'app').

In the context of creating a Flask app, passing __name__ as an argument helps Flask determine the root path for the application, 
which is useful when serving static files or templates. 
It also allows Flask to know whether the script is being run directly or imported as a module.

1-To run this program you have to install Flask and ngrok on your local machine.
2-Write your Flask application code and run it on your local machine using Flask's built-in development server.
3-Start ngrok and create a secure tunnel to your local Flask server by running the following command in your terminal:
4-ngrok http <flask_port>
5-Replace <flask_port> with the port number that your Flask server is listening on (usually 5000 by default).
6-Ngrok will generate a public URL that you can use to access your local Flask server from anywhere on the internet. You can find the URL in the ngrok terminal output or in the ngrok web interface.
7-Use the ngrok-generated URL to access your Flask application from any device with internet access.

Also, IMPORTANT!
Remember that your ngrok session is temporary and the generated URL will change every time you restart ngrok. 
You'll need to update the webhook URL in the Twilio console each time you restart ngrok.

"""

"""  
*Flask*
Flask is a Python web framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. 
One of the challenges in developing a web application is making it accessible over the internet so that others can use it.

***This is where ngrok comes in.***

*ngrok*
ngrok is a tool that allows developers to expose a local web server to the internet. 
It creates a secure tunnel between the local server and a public URL, 
making it possible for anyone on the internet to access the local web server.
